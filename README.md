# CV Hackathon Submission

This is our submission to the Aaltoes Computer Vision Hackathon. Our team participants include [name_1], [name_2], and [name_3]. (Please replace these placeholders with your actual teammate names.)

## Overview

In this project, we tackle the challenge of [briefly describe the challenge or problem]. Our solution leverages modern computer vision techniques to preprocess the data, design and train a robust model, and evaluate its performance with clear visualizations and metrics.

## Approach

Our solution follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning, augmentation, and normalization to prepare the dataset.
2. **Model Design:**
   - Implementation of a model architecture based on [explain architecture, e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks, transfer learning, etc.].
3. **Training:**
   - Hyperparameter tuning, training with validation, and model optimization.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessment using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, along with visualizations for qualitative analysis.

A fully documented Jupyter Notebook (`cv_hackathon.ipynb`) walks through our entire workflow, including code explanations, parameter choices, and visualization of results.
